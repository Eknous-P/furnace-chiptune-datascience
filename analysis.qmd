## The Top

The top 20 most viewed videos are:
```{r}
#| label: topViews
plot_topViews
```
And the top 20 most liked are:
```{r}
#| label: topLikes
plot_topLikes
```
Obviously the most viewed videos will be the most liked.

If we plot by the like / view ratio:
```{r}
#| label: topLikeViewRatio
plot_likeViewRatio
```
Kinda sad that the highest ratio comes from the lowest stats.<br>
I guess it shows who has the most loyal audience?
